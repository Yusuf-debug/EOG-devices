This is actually my EOG devices that i made from EMG module,the EMG has been modified. there's some part of EMG module  that i'd been removed and then calculate according the frequency cut off of EOG, so we can replace some value in LPF and HPF filter. the EMG that will be a EOG devices. the EOG devices have input from electrode, then the output will be connected to pin adc arduino. in this project i try to detect eye movement with indicator of LED. And the code file also using some library from arduino leonardo. It will be used to move the mouse using EOG device.
