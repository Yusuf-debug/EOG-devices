EOG devices
This is actually my EOG devices that i made from EMG module, there's some part that i'd been remove and then calculate according the frequency cut off of EOG. EOG devices have input from electrode, then the output willbe connected to pin adc arduino. in this project i try to detect eye movement with indicator of LED. And the code file also using some library from arduino, that will be use to moving the mouse using EOG.
